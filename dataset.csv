Hindi lng po ito isang beses sa loob ng isang buwan na issue, Kailangan po ibawas nyo yung time na wala kami internet dahil ang seevice ninyo ang binabayaran namin, kapag di nyo naibigay ang serbisyong iyon you need to compensate us, di po mura ang inavailed namin na plan, 2,999 pesos para makakuha kami ng magandang connection. 
Gumagastos po kami ng araw araw para makapag online lng.

Pakiusap po ayusin nyo na ang internet namin, and compensate us sa mga days na walang internet.

28703033,5,"The first call is useless. No action has been done the first agent handled the call promised to escalate my concerns. But no escalation has been made. The second call was quite annoying because of the agent seems to pushing back the concerns to other issues. I gave the ticket number the first agent gave me but it seems empty that is the reason why she can't answer my questions, or perhaps she don't really understand how to resolve my issue and trying to end the call by creating another ticket number again and reassurance. So I asked for a supervisor to help me. At first. The agent hesitant to call a supervisor,  so I tell her that it is impossible for a call center company that there are no available supervisor in each bay or maybe they don't like taking supervisor call, and that added to my frustration. So I asked her again to call a supervisor. I know the agent trying to help me but she can't. So the supervisor take the call and she said she's not a supervisor in that department. But she's still more helpful than the 2 agents. Kudos to ms. Supervisor Jane, Created me a ticket for escalation #0023280690. Before that I said I have ticket number for escalation, I'm just here to follow up, supervisor says there are no ticket number for escalation has been made. Meaning the first agent lie and tricked me to end the call... That is un acceptable. She needs to have more training for product, process and personal development. Anyway, the escalation still on process, the tech texted me for update. That is good it means they are doing something. Thanks.",4

I talked to a rep over the phone and she said the store have available tnt sim card but when I went there the lady told me they don't have any and I need to wait 3 weeks for replacement. She then kept offering me postpaid. I never experience these issues with the other network except billing. I
Speaking of billing, the other charges on my bill was never discuss to me. I don't know what are those extras. Then I paid my bill and your smart app doesn't even show the payment history. It only shows statements under billing history. It is a big joke. You are making your customer rep sounds like a robot by saying the spiel about the smart app but the smart app itself isn't reliable. Try to fix it for your customers because the payments aren't showing under Payment History. Overall, my rating is 0/5 and will never use SMART again.",5

I have been trying to connect with you thru your hotline number but i was being prompted that the landline number i was inputting was invalid. I have tried several times but to no avail. Got frustrated. I wish you could have an easier option to speak with a live agent because what happened to me being locked out was very frustrating!

November 11 palang disconnected na ang wifi ko sa power outlet, means na no usage at all until I get back last Dec. 26. Sabi ng agent sa Chat, naprocess na daw, to find out ng december na walang suspension and my service is still active. Sabi ng next representative na check na and all yung usage ko at confirm na wala akong usage that specific period of time. Wait daw ako next billing, dumating yung bill ko and I was charged in full. Tumawag nako sa hotline at nagpagawa ng ticket. They emailed me ang credit lang sa almost 1 month na no usage of service is 600+php? Seriously? Never ako nag failed to make a payment every month. Disgusting! Yung chat agents nyo, hope etrain nyo ng maayos! And I want compensation na tama. Sa 1 month basically 1 day lang ang nagamit ko pero 600+ lang ang credit?

AJ checked all the bases and informed this writer the possible reason why Deco wifi wasn’t able to connect to the third base. Other option was also provided just in case the  first option won’t work. He explained everything well which is very easy to understand. From the day AJ told this writer what to do, Deco wifi is working well up to present day.

I just learned from my call today that there was a service order to migrate our land line from copper to fiber. No one in my previous calls told me about it. Even the two technicians who visited our house did not inform us of such things. They always say its about the network outage. I just learned today that there are no slots available for the fiber connection. The 2nd to the last agent I talked with today is so indifferent and incapable. She offered no assistance to help me. Just told me to call after sales department and gave me the wrong option to select. As a loyal and long standing customer, I do not deserve such poor service. I find it hard to accept the reasons and excuses given to me. As a leader in the telco industry in the country, PLDT 's service is getting poorer as the years goes by. I used to have a fiber account several years back, that i canceled due to poor connection and service. If you want to stay in business, give your customers good service. Hire competent employees.

She was very thorough and very patient",10
28652296,0,"1. The agent put me on hold after asking for my concern instead of looking into it and doing rapport.
2. After putting me on hold, the agent said he will send me the bill through email. I know my bill since you are sending it through sms. What i need is an EXPLANATION why it’s that high.
3. The agent insisted on sending me the ebill saying he is having issues on the system. When I finally said okay, agent ask if there’s anything else trying to end the call without asking for my email. He told me he will send it to the email of the account owner which is my mom so I ask what’s the email address because my mom don’t do emails. He can’t provide me the email and ask for my email instead. I provided my email and he did not even verify. 
4. Closed the call by thanking Joselyn. I don’t even know who Joselyn is. My name is lovelyn. The same name on my email. I could tell that the agent didn’t even get the correct email address I provided as he addressed me by a diff persons name. 

The agent is obviously just want to get away with the call. This is poor customer service in all levels. No customer deserves this kind of mediocre performance. I’m planning to transfer from sky to pldt here in manila which is supposed to be a 2nd subscription but with how I was assisted I don’t think i will get value for money. 

Lack assurance of help, politeness, product knowledge. No expertise at all. Not all customers can be deceived with your pretense of sending the bill to email when it’s not happening. Very disappointing. This is lengthy and that’s how frustrating you are.",0

The first rep on the call was totally useless! The second rep at least walked me through on how to talk to an actual chat rep. I had to wait for at least 15 mins for the chat rep to reply, information given by the first rep was incomplete. If I  won't ask they will not bother to explain. The second rep was nice. All in all, I had more information found on Google than what they are giving. I have 2 accounts and after waiting for so long for a single reply I was told to contact again for my other account.

28589786,9,"I've been experiencing tremendous issues with my service since the 4th quarter of 2023 and it's still happening. If I were to rate the service itself I'd give it a 6 because of the continous issue that I'm having. It's not just affecting my time, but also my income. I'm investing most of my time to call the hotline because of an ongoing issue that has OBVIOUSLY yet to be fixed. I keep receiving temporary resolutions when I need a LONG-TERM RESOLUTION. This internet connection has a purpose, it's used for work from home. Most of my relatives are working from home and it's affecting their working hours, which impacts our income and I can't afford to risk this on a monthly basis. The reason why I picked '9' as the score is because I know for a fact that these surveys would mirror the performance and metric of THE PEOPLE I SPOKE WITH. I took this into consideration because I work in the bpo industry myself, a manager to be specific and I know that not because the company's service was horrible doesn't mean to say that it should mirror their people. I have great respect for people taking in phone calls and they have to be acknowledged. The person I spoke with was polite, quick and very soft spoken. She is the kind of people that bpo companies should be retaining. I commend her for doing a great job in assisting and because of her service. I am hoping that PLDT would look into providing a LONG-TERM RESOLUTION for their customers and it would be great if they continue to keep people who has great customer service skills just like the person I spoke with. I hope that the person who assisted me gets a tap on the shoulder because she deserves that. BPO can be a tough industry to be in, not every customer understands the shoes these reps are in and so, I thought that a simple survey like this would make a difference.",10

Not at all. But when I called yesterday, I tried to make follow up on my request, Trish never help me at all, I kept on insisting/asking for a supervisor but she refused to give it to any. Honestly Trish tried to played me, I told her that I payed 3 thousand Yesterday thru my CC and I think its late time to post. But she now restricted my wifi!! She also told me that she will give me a one time courtesy credit of 300 pesos but I got an email that Trish only provided a credit of 88 pesos. This is really sh*t. I hate that agent. I hope you guys coach those agent who cant understand what we feel on dead end situation as she always gave resolution that I can't say no!!! And I never heard this agent Emphatize nor say Sorry for everything that PLDT made my whole experience worst!!!! I hate you for restricting my account.the only reason I had that balance because I was expecting a credit and was told that it was approved then Trish told me that is was Denied. PLDT/Agents LIED to me since then. F*ck' I HATE YOU FOR JUST GIVING ME 88 pesos credit instead of 300!!! You made me feel that I am idiot and begging for that! F*ck you Trish! GO TO HELL!!

All of these, despite properly providing him all the important information and screenshots that he needed. These call backs and further follow up would have been unnecessary if that agent focused on reading my responses properly to avoid being repetitive and coordinating the matter instead of using bot-like phrases reposted for multiple times in which for most part didn't make a lot of sense and were actually deemed incorrect as his chats went on.

28424605,1,"This is my 4th time to call to dispute the bill on my roaming charges.

1. When I was in Japan, I was misinformed by the agent that I can connect and register to promo for roaming charges and I will not be charged even if I open my mobile data, but after a second i was already notified I got charges.
2. I never used my roaming while in Japan as mentioned by them there is a problem in my account for data network connection.
3. I called again to dispute as I see charges on the account even if it is already seen that I never used my net data. Agent sent it to billing but IDK the turn around time.
4. I can see that it is still reflected in my account, billing dep said it is valid after disputing. Why should I pay on something that I never used and your system knows that i my account have issues connecting in internet overseas. But i never know how previous agent documented this.
5. It will be sent again to billing department to appeal but the internet data performance is already affecting, not sure if it's because i have a due. But previous agent said that it is ok to pay only the plan and not the roaming charges. But the internet is extremely slow!",4

I now wanted to cancel my service since you have been inconveniencing me during my work hours. (Since using it for my work was the only reason I needed an internet connection).
You wanted me to pay you a cancellation fee, but you would never compensate me for the work hours that I've lost everytime my system doesn't work because of your incompetent internet connection! 

Your service sucks and I regretted that I gave pldt a chance. My office provided me an internet connection for two years under Converge and I've never experienced this kind of service with them. 

I'm only giving you another week to fix this issue or I am going to complain to any one who would allow me to cancel my service without the cancellation fee since obviously this is all of your fault!

He even say fuck you to me over the phone. I have asked for that call to be callibrated and that agent needs a sanction for unpleasing behavior he displayed during our conversation. This experienced that I have can lead me to terminate my plan with you because of your poor customer service, misleading information and unprofessional customer service representative. I am a valued customer of PLDT for many years and with this experienced I was totally disappointed big time. I called in again today and made a follow up. But still same words being said by your representative. It keeps me thinking if I can still trust your agents.

This type of incident should have been address and resolve immediately since it did happened to a lot of customers already. And this being unresolved for a longer time (3days given timeline but unsure yet if it will be fixed) means the company did not improve their service and did not made any solutions to this kind of incident. Up until today a lot of customer is suffering from sudden internet loss without proper explanation or reason shows how the company lacks customer satisfaction, service and performance! Such a shame that a company like PLDT who has been in the industry for decades is still having this kind of unresolved issue for a long time.

Wiz didn't seem to know what to do, asked me repeatedly for documents which I have already sent a screenshot (transaction on the Smart website, successful transfer of Maya payment to Smart) asked for information which I had just given (full name, tel no.), asking me to coordinate with the app I used (it was on Smart website on my laptop as I repeatedly advised). And Wiz didn't give clear information, just said it will be resolved and to monitor it without giving clear info how and when. I had to ask for the timeline. The manner in which Wiz handled this is very frustrating. And importantly, until now the reload has not been credited to my account. It has been 6 days. If Smart will not credit me what I paid for, then refund the amount please.",1

28259247,3,"Good afternoon Ma'am/Sir🤗 Maraming salamat Po sa pagkakataon na ito na binigyan nyo Po Ako Ng pagkakataon na ma e raise ang concerns ko Po sa inyo.Pagpaumanhin nyo Po itong sasabihin ko. Nais ko lang maging honest sa inyo kung ano Ang totoong naging experience Namin sa loob Ng mahigit 2yrs Po🤗Mabilis Po Ang PLDT at natutuwa Po Ako dun😍 Subalit po ano ang sense Ng bilis nito kung Araw2 nalng Po sa ngaun ay Wala Kaming net..Ang totoo matagal ko Ng pinagtyagaan Ang Service nyo Dito sa Caloocan to be honest lang Po. Ung linya Namin jn sa QC ay walang problema Naman. Maayos at mabilis talga at kabaliktaran sa linya Namin Dito sa Mountain Heights😪 Nun Bago pa lang ito nakabit way back 2 yrs ago nakaexperience na agad kami Ng mahigit 1 wk na walang net..kaya nais ko nga un ipaputol sa totoo lang kaso Savi nun nakaassign Dito na tao nyo Po. C Sir Bernardino need Namin tapusin Ang contract pa. Kaya no choice ako. Gang medyo sinanay ko nalng na pawala Wala ung net Namin. Laging katwiran Ng technician nyo e naapektuhan dw ito sa ginagawang MRT kaso need ba na lagi nalng ganun Ang tanggapin Namin na dahilan..e ung sa baba Namin na computer shop PLDT dn cla bakit d nila nararanasan Ang nararanasan Namin .Kung nakaraan na taon Po ay madalas lang Ang pagkawala Ng net Namin .Mula Po Dec nag-upgrade na ito. Halos Araw2 na Po Mula pa Dec Wala Kaming net sa Araw at Gabi nalng Po ngkakaroon. Bandang 10pm gang 12am. Magkaroon at madalas mawala-wala Ang signal..Bandang 2am nagtuloy-tuloy na itong maging maayos gang Umaga Po Bandang 6am to 7am at mawawalan na naman kami po Ng net😪 Kahit nun huling  nacheck ito last Dec Ng Technician Po ninyo e 2 days lang Po itong tumino. After 2 days Ayan pawala Wala na Naman gang ngaun. Ilang linggo na Po ito na Araw2 Ganyan. Naging palaisipan na Po sa akin bakit ganun? Akala ko ung router Ang sira o anuman kaso ngkakaroon kami Ng net sa hating gabi. Subalit last Friday at gang kagabi madaling Araw na ito ngkakaroon..Parang nakaset na Po ito sa ganun na Oras. Hating Gabi o kaya madaling Araw mgkaroon at gang Umaga lang dn. Kaya dna Po worth it ang service..sad to say Po at pacnsya na kayo as in subrang stress na Ako sa Service talga. Mabilis nga kaso d na namin nagagamit KC tulog na kami o matutulog na kami pagka nagkaroon. Sayang Ang binabayad Po Namin at double gastos pa kami dahil need ko mgpaload para may net na magagamit mga anak ko na nag-aaral😪 Sa panahon po ngaun mahalaga Po Ang net at pagka walang net Ang Bahay Po Ang gulo Ng mga Bata. Parang Ang laki na Ng problema nila hahaa😅 Kaya sana maunawaan nyo Po Ako.  Nagsawa na dn Po akong e report ito Ng paulit ulit KC Wala pong naging improvement😪 At Lalo pa pong lumalala. Alam Ng technician nyo Po Ang mga hinaing ko sa Service nyo. Sana ay wag dn Po kayong magagalit sa mga sinabi ko. Naging honest lang dn Po Ako sa inyo. Ung PLDT landline  nga Po Namin simula pa lang Ng kinabit Ang net namin d na Po un gumagana at hinayaan ko lang Po. Basta ganito Po. Sa Umaga 3 Ang ngbeblink Ng Green( PON, WLAN1, WLAN 2) Ang Power Green dn at steady lang..ung sa LOS Po d Naman nagblink Ng red. Kaya Napapaisip Ako bakit Araw 2 ganito.. naiisip ko dn nga Po kung possible ba na may nakawan na nagaganap gaya Ng kuryente hahha😅 Mula sa wirings hahaha. KC d na po coincidence lang ito Ma'am/ Sir😪 Araw2 same set up. Obvious na nakaset na ito.. Nais ko pong malaman Kung may pag-asa pa Po ba na maging maayos Ang linya Po Namin..kung may second option Po ba kayo na gagawin.  KC d Naman Po pwede na mgtyga Ng magtyaga nalang Po kami na mgbabayad Ng 2k monthly tapos magpaload pa kami . Doble gastos lang Po ito sa hirap Po Ng buhay ngaun. Sorry Po Ma'am/ Sir😪 Naging tapat lang Po Ako kung ano Ang totoo. Maraming salamat dn Po sa pang-unawa🤗 Nawa ay magawan nyo ito Ng paraan at kung maari ay palitan ung dpat palitan gaya Ng Landline Namin na d Naman gumagana ni kailan. Or baka ung pinaglagyan Ng box namin...  dko alam Kung  dun ba Ang problema galing o baka sa router mismo. UmaAsa Po Ako na maaksyunan nyo ito Ng Tama at may mangyari na pong pagbabago sa service nyo, subalit kung Wala Po talaga. Ok lang Po Ma'am/Sir baka sa second option nalang Po Ako. Maraming salamat Po🤗",5

28109327,1,"I have many reasons however I'll just say a few. 

1.Loss and Poor Service, we pay every penny before our due date but still having this problem. 

2. Customer service experience, our customer service experience is nothing but a worse experience. They always say the ""Mandatory spiel"" LIKE WE GET IT! SOME QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERABLE BY YES OR NO BUT most of the agents say similar things and it's kinda frustrating.

- They keep lying to me, if you guys are going to listen to the calls you would know that they keep saying misinformation, which is a mistreat. 
They lie about almost everything I also got the names who assisted us and also the employee number. 

3. PLDT HOTLINE - If you wanted to dial technical department and if you have existing ticket you will be routed to the generated IVR then at the end of the call just got drop. Then when I dial again and ask billing to transfer me over to tech They are giving me a hard time. SO INCONVENIENCE JUST LIKE TODAY'S INTERRACTION THE NAME of the representative is CHARLES I ask to transfer to tech then I take 30 mins to talk to HIM just to transfer to tech, he keeps insisting to me that he can't transfer me due to the outage ticket and he's saying that it's okay ALREADY! worst experience.",0

When i spoke with him there was not a bit of sincerity and concern in his voice. In fact he was so condescending and no help was given at all.,0

27971279,0,"I don't really want to call as I thought my issue is a ''user's end'' fault. I did my research and managed to open the other ports via the router's settings. Which I actually can't believe I have to do, just to use the other ports. I restarted the modem and tested the connection, but changing the settings does not seem to make it work. A friend of mine advised to give you guys a call. I restarted the modem to double-check the connections but it still has the same issue.

The IVR told me that an issue is detected regarding power that created an automatic ticket I didn't even get a chance to speak to a live agent. My router is already up and running at that time yet it still detected that it was off. 

I called the number again and I was able to get Jen.
I requested her to open the ports of my PLDT router because only port 1 is open. She told me about the power issue ticket that I currently have and then mentions that she could not create a request ticket for me because I still have that ticket open, she told me that its 1 ticket per person only. Jen said that they will come to our place to fix the issue, I told her to just cancel it because I don't need it and just proceed with my port request. Jen insists that cancellation of that ticket is not possible and only its up to the decisions of the tech. 

1 ticket per person? At a time?? Why can't I confirm that a ticket is no longer needed straight during the call??
I can't believe that this is PLDT's process or if Jen is outright lying to my face.",0

Hindi ko alam kung anong klaseng sistema meron kayo jan sa PLDT para sabihing nagamit namin ang service sa mga araw na sinasabi kong down and out ang internet connection dito sa aming lugar. Hindi ito isolated sa isang bahay lamang kundi maraming users ang naapektuhan.

Your Staffs can't do anything. Called multiple times always saying that there is no request for relocation kahit pwede nyo naman i-check ang notes na tumatawag kami for how many times since December ang nagrirequest for relocation, di ba kayo nakakarealize na we have been calling for so many times just to relocate the service but ending up no resolution and calling again and again? What's so hard in relocating the service? kung wala lang kaming contract matagal na kaming nagpacancel , plus lagi pang nababar ang service kahit the bill is not yet due.What's happening PLDT?

27890424,6,"I paid my bill online and it got an error message so I retried. However, upon checking my balance I got deducted twice. I called the third party app, Maya and they confirmed that the funds have left and is with Smart and that I should process the reversal with Smart. I filed a case and called customer service and their posting is not real time. Further, despite my initial report I was advised to callback after 24hrs ensuring posting and then file for refund. Setting expectations, upon filing it takes 7 business days for Smart to process refund and that it would be refunded in store not online. In this day and age your refund process is archaic. You take real time to take our money but it takes forever for you to process a reversal. This will not be the case if your apps are working properly and your servers are reliable in processing payments. Because of this I went out of budget. Some of my other bills went overdue and incurred penalties including my ISP which I rely on to work from home. Because of this, I was also absent from work missing days worth of income because my internet was disconnected. I filed for early termination of your service over the phone but it was denied without any retention offer. Simply that it would be hard for me to discontinue my services over the phone and referred me in person again to process my service disconnection. Your after sales service sucks!",6

It went smooth and they told me that it will be done immediately. Months passed and we still received the Php1699 bill. I called earlier this day and the operator found out that no reports were submitted by the Davao office regarding my request. PLDT Davao is so incompetent. They could have called me since they already had my number if ever there were problems to my request. Now I was told by the operator that I could not get any refund from my overpayment or even deduct my current payment for the excess that I paid. 100% would not recommend PLDT.",10

Better to tell us the truth ALWAYS, that's why we are calling and asking questions - we want to know the TRUTH from you as you are knowledgeable about the services you provide. Because what just happened is fraud, falsifying information to existing customers.

27863412,0,"I GOT THIS LINK FROM PLDTListens. Obviously PLDT DOES NOT LISTEN. PLEASE LISTEN/PAY ATTENTION TO THIS FEEDBACK AND READ ON to see how you’ve made my simple concern so complicated and caused me so much stress! 

I called 171 last Jan. 4, 2024, Thursday at around 1:30PM for a SIMPLE REPLACEMENT OF MY DEFECTIVE MODEM and talked to Chris. I told him I will be away the next day, and to schedule a house visit after that day. He gave me ticket number 62224983 to track my case via pldthome.com/pldt-tracker. Since that day, every day until now, that ticket number has resulted to “Sorry, we did not find any application using the service reference number you entered.” YOUR TICKET TRACKER IS USELESS!

Still, I got a call the following morning informing me that a technician will be arriving. I told him I will be out as I’ve said in my call yesterday to 171, to please come tomorrow, SATURDAY, instead, and he agreed. At 6:38PM Friday, I received a text message from PLDTService saying “This is to confirm your scheduled appointment with our technician on 01/07/24, BETWEEN 08am - 12NN for ticket no.62224983. Thank you!” NOW IT’S MOVED TO SUNDAY.

SATURDAY EARLY MORNING at 6:11AM I got a text message saying “Your repair request is now assigned to our field service team. Our technician will contact you to visit your premises, if needed… [etc.]” I stayed home all day SATURDAY to get it over with even if I suddenly had a WAKE to go to, which I now moved to Sunday. Then at 4PM, SATURDAY, I again got the text message from PLDTService saying: “This is to remind you of your scheduled technician visit on 01/07/24, between 08AM - 12NN. Please text NO to [09191601896] if you need a new schedule then expect a call within 24hrs, Otherwise, we will proceed as scheduled… [etc.]” I JUST WASTED A WHOLE DAY WAITING! I promptly texted NO to 09191601896 in order to reschedule, but got the same text message over and over again! YOUR AUTOMATIC MESSAGING IS USELESS!

I was extremely stressed out at this point and called 171 again and first talked to agent Aljo to explain the situation. Midway through my explanation I suddenly got a busy tone. SHE CUT OFF THE CALL. I called 171 again and talked to agent Kim, ID# AI00200. I explained everything and requested to reschedule the technician visit on JAN. 9, TUESDAY, from 1PM upwards, and to NOT BOTHER ME THE NEXT DAY, SUNDAY. Kim assured me that she has recorded my report and relayed it to the concerned department. 

STILL, ON SUNDAY, I MISSED AN EARLY MORNING CALL ON LANDLINE and later received a call on mobile phone. I said I’ll be away the whole day and have rescheduled with 171 for TUESDAY AFTERNOON. AND AGAIN, ON SUNDAY AT 4:10PM, I GOT A TEXT MESSAGE: “Our technician, ALCONTADO - 546254, is on the way to your place. Estimated arrival is around 16:08. Your PLDT Service code is 10858172… [etc.]” DOES PLDT REALLY LISTEN???

Finally today, Tuesday, I received a call and got a technician visit from Anthony and he replaced my modem within 10 minutes.

Every call I got from PLDT, they all asked me what my concern was! OBVIOUSLY PLDT NEVER LISTENS! WHAT KIND OF (TELE)COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY ARE YOU??? SIMPLENG BAGAY, ANG HIRAP NIYO KAUSAP!!!",0

I mentioned on my call that I received a restriction message and I haven't received any acknowledgment message that the payment had gone through. I paid on Sunday and it's already Tuesday but there's no a payment acknowledgement. Rather, a restriction message had been delivered. I know that the account is active because I can browse the internet. The reason for my call is an explanation on why I received the restriction message and no acknowledgement message. Is it a glitch on your system? Is it just me that is affected? I didn't get the answer. This is a very light issue since the account is still active. I might have gotten angry and the adviser didn't get mad but don't pacify customers with crap/unnecessary answers. Active listening is crucial. Listen to the customer cues.",4

So its been almost 17 days of No internet and landline and I now just received  a billing statement from PLDT.

Why will I pay when I have I had no service and no one came to fix it?

You can only complain to customer service repeatedly and the problem still remains unsolved. The technicians need to pay extra to help you repair it diligently. Otherwise, their so-called schedule to arrange repairs is a lie and they are not coping with the task. The phones and wifi of three of my pldts are broken.

Please address & resolve all ly concerns because again those not resolved. Incpming call is fine on the landline phone again the problem is the outgoing calls. We cannot make an outgling calls.

We were told that 1 ticket will just need 1 visit from the technician, but we had several visits/ inspections, apparently because the initial technicians findings need to be verified by other technicians and will need to be verified daw again and again while there is an open ticket. Which led us to ask when will they finally believe the findings and work on the solution. The recorded request was made December 30, 2023. The only thing new is that we were issued a new ticket. To date, we still don't have any internet connection and our landline phone is still not working properly, and our request for a working telephone must have fallen on deaf ears.",0

27903056,0,"Customer service/Billing department provides low service at all. They wasted my 1 hour and 40 minutes waiting on the phone for nothing. Representative Jay (employee id 90143) did not even bother to take an alternative resolution to resolve my issue. We just wanted to know the bill as we did not receive our billing statement through text/email. We took an initiative to update our email address just to receive the bill, however, he said that our case is for investigation and may took 24hrs to resolve. Our concern is that it is already our due date and it may result in cutting off our service. We requested for a supervisor and he mentioned that no one is available at that time (horrible). No one from the higher team prioritize us knowing that we are already the one who is reaching out to fulfill our dues. It took me 1 hour and 10 minutes to talk to a supervisor (the heck!). Supervisor Grace (employee id 74883) took the call without reviewing all the concern we discussed from the previous representative Jay. She is unprepared/not trained handling a supervisory call. We then said that we want to take the survey and she mentioned that it will be sent to us through the phone number registered on the account (the hell! When in fact it's our maun concern not receiving any text blast coming from PLDT). She keeps on insisting that it is the only option to get our responses about all the inconvenience they brought. She placed me on hold for almkslot 10 minutes and never go back. I then decided to hang up as it is almost 2 hours that I am on the ohone with this careless people. This customer service is so low and no care at all. We already reaching out with the NTC to review all of this. I will post this on facebook and all my social media platform with all the recordings I have all throughout the conversation. Your people doesn't care at all. I WILL NOT RECOMMEND PLDT TO ANYONE AT ALL!!

My previous calls with you guys are way too far compared to what I experienced today. That being said, I came to conclusion that I won't be needing the service you are providing any longer since you guys are not considerate with your customer's concerns. I even asked for a supervisor but the agent was not able to provide - given the fact that he put me on hold for couple of times! 
Worst experience so far and I hope this won't happen again to any of your customers who are experiencing struggles and unprecedented events, aside from that, I got family problems as well. Instead of having the assurance and sympathy, I got the opposite treatment.",0

After many frustrated calls, tech arrived only Jan 3. For 3 years every Dec during holidays and when needed most always issue LOS !!! Unbelievable but true. Do you call this good service ""PLDT cares"" ??? I am sick and tired of this issue. We have visitors no internet our maids and nurse/caregiver need it also to call their loved ones but no wifi !!! Nobody in pldt seems to care. Busy e joying their holidays.  For 3 consecutive years ... Coincidence or planned ???  We have 4 mesh already so no dead spot supposed to be in my house but gosh no internet when needed the most !!! And they always try to fix online when their technician already said need to fix the main box here so when they finally came Jan 3 onsite they fixed. So what's the problem ??? No people to come when needed ??? Does PLDT really can provide good service to us ??? We are paying on time but you cut our line connections when we needed it the most !!! Happy holidays for us because of PLDT !!!",3

Para naman sa Smart Services, maaring hindi ko mairerekomenda. Bibigyan ko ng 2 para sa serbisyo. Hindi naman kasalanan ni Pauleene na hindi nya maiconvert ang 1000 pesos na promo load into a regular load sa kadahilanang wala namang proseso ang SMART bilang isang kompanya na ilang taon ng nasa industriya. 2024 na po, sana ay maiaayos niyo ang serbisyo sa lahat ng mamamayang Pilipino. Bigyan niyo naman sana kami ng maayos at fair na services dahil lahat at bawat peso at sentimo na binibigay namin sa inyong kumpaya ay pinaghirapan.

I called CSR to process an adjustment and unlike before I did not receive any ticket number notification for the adjustment ticket that was made. The Support told me that she created the adjustment ticket and it's usual that we won't be receiving any notification as this was processed internally and will just reflect on my next bill. I am really disappointed that the customer service lied to me. I am paying 2,500 for this service and PLDT keeps dissapointing me. I will just wait for my contract to end and will switch service. I also checked negative feedbacks online and find out that this is the normal way of how PLDT CSR handled customer's issue. I am working in a BPO also and recommended PLDT to my colleagues but they are also complaining the same way you guys handled our problem with your network.",0

The reason I called again today is to complain that my Dec 18 complain (no dial tone) was already reported closed and corrected which is  not true and lie by the technician whi visited us last Dec 23. That technician was not able to correct the problem because he is alone and cannot trace the problem on the pole. He said he will be back but instead reported the problem solved. I observed that this dishonestly on problem reporting is rampant in PLDT tech customer service, most of their contracted trouble shooters almost always report problem solved even if the problem still exist just to stop the clock ticking on their job because their superiors AND PLDT do not verify if indeed the reported problem was indeed solved. PLDT do not verify if problems were really corrected by calling the complainant and hear their side, PLDT do not gave technician rating system to assess the quality of job their contractors performed in the field.

Tickets are always being placed on resolved and fixed although I wasnt even being called on my phone regarding the repair appointment. Just a suggestion, it shouldn't be 1-3 days to fix the issue, customers should be asked when will be the best appointment date that they wish to get visited so that we will not be staying up all day to wait for tech call because we also work at night. Hope this will be escalated to the supervisors or to youe senior operations manager. Thank you!",0

Pero pinaka worst nitong 3rd or 4th week Ng November Hanggang ngayun jan. 1, 2024 wala Akong connection. Every other day na kung tawagan ko ang customer service para sa issue Ng connection ko pero until now wala pa rin ako connection. 

At ang pinaka Malala binigyan pa ako Ng billing na buo kahit Hindi ko na konsumo Ng mahigit Isang buwan ang PLDT wifi.

27546071,6,"I am writing to provide feedback regarding the services provided by your team as a third-party field contractor for our internet service provider. While we appreciate the efforts put forth, we have encountered challenges that have resulted in delays in the restoration of our internet service. It is essential for us to address these issues in order to ensure the timely and effective resolution of service interruptions.

1. Delayed Restoration: On several occasions, we have experienced delays in the restoration of our internet service following outages or disruptions. These delays have had a significant impact on our operations and have caused inconvenience for our customers.

2. Premature Ticket Closures: There have been instances where tickets related to service interruptions have been closed without an on-site visit being conducted, leading to unresolved issues and further delays in the restoration of service.

As a valued partner in ensuring the reliability of our internet service, we believe that addressing these issues is crucial for maintaining a high level of service quality and customer satisfaction.

We kindly request that the following actions be taken to improve the situation:

- Clear Communication: We ask for improved communication and transparency regarding the status of service restoration efforts, including timely updates on the progress of on-site visits and issue resolution.

- Adherence to SLA: We expect strict adherence to the agreed-upon service level agreement (SLA) in terms of response times, on-site visits, and ticket closure procedures.

- Quality Assurance: We encourage the implementation of quality control measures to verify on-site visits and ensure that all relevant issues are properly addressed before ticket closure.",7
